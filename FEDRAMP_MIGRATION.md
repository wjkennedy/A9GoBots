# FedRAMP Migration Guidance

This project assists Atlassian Data Center customers who must migrate to Atlassian Cloud under FedRAMP requirements. We provide resources and automation ("GoBots") to help teams make the transition smoothly.

## Key Features

- **CFIUS-compliant resourcing** – all migration support is delivered by US personnel cleared to handle sensitive data.
- **Tool sets for GovCloud** – sample automation and scripts tailored for deploying Atlassian products in GovCloud environments.
- **Migration planning** – guidance on mapping existing Data Center workflows to Atlassian Cloud services.
